## Create a virtual environment

Creating a virtual environment will isolate the libraries for one project from another and is very useful when you have multiple Python applications running on a single server.

To create a virtual environment, perform the following:

```
# Create a new folder for your files:
$ mkdir ~/aivo

# Make sure you are in the above directory:
$ cd ~/aivo

# Install and create the virtual environment (on mac/linux):
$ sudo apt-get install python3-venv
$ python3 -m venv flask_env

# Activate the virtualenv created recently:
$ source flask_env/bin/activate

# NOTE: when you are done with your virtualenv, you can run:
$ deactivate
```
